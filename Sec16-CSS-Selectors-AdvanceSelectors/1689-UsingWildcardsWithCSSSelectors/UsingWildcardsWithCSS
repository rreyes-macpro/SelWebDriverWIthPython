Using wildcards in CSS Selectors:
    “^” -> Represents the starting text
    “$” -> Represents the ending text
    “*” -> Represents the text contained Syntax:
tag[attribute<special character>=’value’]


in the case of finding a class where the first word equals = 'inputs'
    input[class^='inputs']
it will just show 2 matching node since there are 2 class where there are 2 inputs as value

    Examples:
    input[class='inputs'] -> Only 1 matching node
    input[class^='inputs'] -> Two matching nodes
    input[class='displayed-class'] - No matching nodes
    input[class$='class'] -> One matching node  , it also ends in class
    input[class*='displayed-class'] -> One matching node
