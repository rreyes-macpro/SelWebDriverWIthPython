"." -> Class (Shortut key to find class)


.inputs  -> will show 2 matching nodes (dont use something like this), locator found 2 classes with the name "inputs"
input.inputs ( no difference)

input[class=displayed-class] -> this will show "no matching node"
        why? because the attribute class does not contain only 1 class, it also contains the other class(primary) which is "inputs"

input[class ='inputs displayed-class'] -> this will show 1 matching node by sung the full class(multiple)


We can also use appending classes
    .class1.class2.calss3 -> until we find a unique element

lets do this

    .inputs - starting with this, we still find 2 matching nodes


then append

    .inputs.displayed-class - then we find 1 matching node



The Open Window

Clicking the open window shows 1 matching node, notice the class (2 classes) and using the class attr

    .btn-style -> shows 6 matching nodes, because all the 6 items in the page using the same layout class to design the css style

by appending:

    .btn-style.class1 -> we still find 2 matching nodes (Open window and Open Tab items)
    .btn-style.class1.class2 -> will find the Open Tab item button

 how about the "Open Window"?

    just type  #openwindow as the id and it will highlight the "Open Window" item
